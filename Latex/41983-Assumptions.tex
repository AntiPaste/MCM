\section{Assumptions}

(We make several assumptions to simplify our model)
\begin{itemize}

\item Spread of Ebola can be modelled by day by day simulation similar to classical SIR models
\item Ebola can be cured with a (magical) medicine, which takes effect within a day, (thus essentially immediately according to our model,) which leaves the person in a recovered state: they are immune to disease and cannot infect other people
\item Affect of change of seasons, natural births and deaths, immigration and political conflicts, is omitted
\item Medicine production rates are based on vaccine production rates in \NB


\end{itemize}
